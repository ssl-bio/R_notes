  abstract = {This book provides an elementary-level introduction to R, targeting both non-statistician scientists in various fields and students of statistics. The main mode of presentation is via code examples with liberal commenting of the code and the output, from the computational as well as the statistical viewpoint. A supplementary R package can be downloaded and contains the data sets. The statistical methodology includes statistical standard distributions, one- and two-sample tests with continuous data, regression analysis, one- and two-way analysis of variance, regression analysis, analysis of tabular data, and sample size calculations. In addition, the last six chapters contain introductions to multiple linear regression analysis, linear models in general, logistic regression, survival analysis, Poisson regression, and nonlinear regression.},
